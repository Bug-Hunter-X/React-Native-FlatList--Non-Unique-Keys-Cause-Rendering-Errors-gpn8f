This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid key to the data items.  React Native's FlatList relies on unique keys to efficiently manage and render list items. If the keys are not unique, it can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, performance issues, and in some extreme cases, crashes.  The error might manifest in different ways, such as items disappearing, showing up in the wrong order, or even causing the app to become unresponsive. 

```javascript
// Incorrect usage with non-unique keys
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 3'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // id is not unique
/>
```
